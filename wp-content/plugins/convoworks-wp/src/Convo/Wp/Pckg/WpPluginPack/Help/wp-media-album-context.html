    <h3>WP Album Media Context</h3>

    <p>
        Defines WP_Query which will return audio files from custom posts types of an playlist to be streamed via audio player components.
    </p>

    <h4>Arguments</h4>

    <p>
        All arguments are passed to the real WP_Query class except <b>offset</b> which is 0 and <b>paged</b> which is always set to true.
        Meaning that there is no paination here. Setting the <b>posts_per_page</b> you will set the max results in a playlist (20 by default).
        <br>
        You can use expressions when defining arguments. How to use expressions check on the
        <a target="_blank" href="https://convoworks.com/docs/publishers/component-reference/expression-language/">Convoworks documentation</a> pages.
        <br>
        The expressions are evaluated in the service scope so here you can not use internal variables which are available inside container elements e.g. Loop element.
    </p>

    <h4>Other parameters</h4>
    <p>
        All other parameters are optional - allowed empty by the platforms (e.g. artwork) or the Convoworks provides required values.
        All parameters are accepting expressions which will be evaluated in the service context.
        Most of them are also in the post context, meaning that the "post" variable is available in the context (the real \Wp_Post object from the loop).
    </p>

    <h4>Album Song Parameters</h4>
    <p>
        Whit those two parameters you can access songs that are stored in the post meta of an album post.
        The fist parameter has to be an resolved array which represents the album songs and contains song related data.
        THe second parameter is just the name of an single song which will be used in song related parameters.
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>Songs of Album - can be an expression like <code>${get_post_meta(post.ID,"album",true)}</code></li>
        <li>Song of Album - just a name for the single song of <b>Songs of Album</b></li>
    </ul>

    <h4>Default settings parameters</h4>
    <p>
        <b>Default loop status</b> and <b>Default shuffle status</b> are defining initial values which will be used when your user starts the player for the first time.
    </p>

    <h4>Media info</h4>
    <p>
        WP Media Context provides media info data which you can use through connected components (e.g. Media info element, Media block).
        In these components, you will provide a name under which this data (associative array) will be available and here are the fields it consists of.
    </p>
    <ul style="padding-left: 15px; list-style: disc;">
        <li><b>current</b> IAudioFile, current song</li>
        <li><b>next</b> IAudioFile, next song if exists</li>
        <li><b>count</b> integer, playlist songs count</li>
