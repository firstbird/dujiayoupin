<div>
    <h3>WP Query ELement</h3>

    <p>Gives access to the page info (and WP_Query object) defined by the WP Query Context component.</p>
    
    <h4>When to use?</h4>
    <p>
        This element allows you to quickly check if there are any results and based on that you can prepare the right user workflow. For example, you might define
        different responses or conversation steps if there are no results, if there are just one result and if there are multiple pages of the results.
    </p>
    
    <h4>Not in the loop</h4>
    <p>
        While you have access to the WP_Query object, you can access all its members and you can even loop over <b>query.posts</b> array, 
        note that in such cases you are not in the WordPress loop and you can not use wp functions without arguments.
        <br>
        If you would like to do a quick, but fully functional loop over resulting posts you can use "WP Loop Element" and place it inside "Has results" flow.
    </p>
