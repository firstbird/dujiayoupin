    <ol>
        <li>
            <span>Make sure you already have configured and propagated your service to Amazon Alexa with Account Linking enabled in <b>Account Linking Mode</b> <i>'Installation'</i>.</span>
        </li>

        <li>
            <span>Enter variable name for the user in <i>Name</i> field Name under which to store the loaded user object in the context</span>
        </li>

        <li>
            <span>You can leave the <b>Set as Current User</b> checked as this will set the current wp user as the User which has linked the account. Initially no user is set in the service.
