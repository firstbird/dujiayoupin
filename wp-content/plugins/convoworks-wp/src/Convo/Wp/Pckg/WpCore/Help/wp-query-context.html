    <h3>WP Query Context</h3>

    <p>
    Defines WP_Query to be used as the source for the other WP specific components. 
    It maintains the pagination and post selection info across the session. 
    </p>
    
    <h4>Arguments</h4>

    <p>
        All arguments are passed to the real WP_Query class except <b>offset</b> which is calculated dynamically and <b>paged</b> which is always set to true.
        You can use expressions when defining arguments. How to use expressions check on the 
        <a target="_blank" href="https://convoworks.com/docs/publishers/component-reference/expression-language/">Convoworks documentation</a> pages.
        <br>
        The expressions are evaluated in the service scope so here you can not use internal variables which are available inside container elements e.g. Loop element.
    </p>
    
    <h4>Maintaining the pagination</h4>
    <p>
        As mentioned, this component keeps track of the current page during the navigation through results. 
        If you want to rewind it to the beginning (e.g. if the sort order changed), you can do it by providing an expression which evaluates to true to 
        <b>Rewind navigation</b> component property.
        <br>
        If you want to maintain pagination by yourself, you can set <b>offset</b> parameter in args.
    </p>
    
    <h4>Page and post info</h4>
    <p>

        In this components, you will provide name under which this data (associative array) will be available and here are the fields it consists of.
