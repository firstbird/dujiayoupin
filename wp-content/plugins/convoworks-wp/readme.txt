The most versatile no-code solution for WordPress!

== Description ==

**Convoworks WP** is more than just a conversation tool. It's a sophisticated no-code, universal workflow builder seamlessly integrated into your WordPress. Rooted in Convoworks, an [open source PHP framework](https://github.com/zef-dev/convoworks-core), you can craft intricate workflows without typing a single line of code.

Convoworks employs visual programming, allowing users to design workflows through a drag-and-drop interface, much like a visual flowchart. These workflows can then be executed by various triggers, including REST-based interactions and WordPress hooks.

For users familiar with visual builders like Elementor or Divi, Convoworks is a game-changer. While these visual builders handle design and layout, Convoworks allows you to take dynamic functionality a step further. Now, without writing a line of code, you can:

* Tweak website behaviors using WordPress hooks.
* Set up custom API endpoints to communicate with external services.
* Fetch and display data from external APIs seamlessly.
* Automate processes based on specific website events or user interactions.

Convoworks bridges the gap between design and dynamic functionality, granting even non-coders the power to fully customize and automate their WordPress sites.

**Who can use this plugin and how?**

* **Website Owners**: If you're comfortable with tools like Elementor, you'll feel right at home with Convoworks. Use it to implement modifications on your website that would typically need coding knowledge.

* **Agencies**: Convoworks offers a twofold advantage. First, with the support for service templates, agencies can rapidly deploy pre-defined solutions, cutting down the development time significantly. These ready-made solutions don't require the involvement of programmers, making deployment swift and hassle-free. Secondly, the platform is built with customization in mind. If you have unique challenges or specific problems to solve, you can easily design and integrate specialized workflow components into Convoworks. This flexibility ensures that you can simplify and optimize workflows tailored to your or your clients' needs.

* **Plugin Developers**: Elevate your plugin with the Convoworks custom package. Craft specialized components that hone in on your specific data or services, and establish a set of pre-defined service templates. These templates can cater to the most common requirements of your plugin users, allowing them to benefit from a robust, pre-configured solution.

[Convoworks' GPT package](https://github.com/zef-dev/convoworks-gpt) offers an integration with the OpenAI GPT API. Not only does it provide basic API access, but it also incorporates advanced components allowing dynamic context insertion and control over conversation length. This ensures seamless and sophisticated AI-driven capabilities in workflows.
